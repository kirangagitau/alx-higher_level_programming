	PYTHON CLASSES & OBJECTS
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. 
An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are 
instances (objects) of the int class.
Objects can store data using ordinary variables that belong to the object. Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as fields.
Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class. Such functions are called methods of the class. This terminology 
is important because it helps us to differentiate between functions and variables which are independent and those which belong to a class or object. 
Collectively, the fields and methods can be referred to as the attributes of that class. Fields are of two types - they can belong to each 
instance/object of the class or they can belong to the class itself. They are called instance variables and class variables respectively.
A class is created using the class keyword. The fields and methods of the class are listed in an indented block.

	Data Structures in Python

Files in this folder are dealing the actions of python data structures.
Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, 
which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items 
of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.

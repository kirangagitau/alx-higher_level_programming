# HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING
High-level programming refers to programming languages that are designed to be easily understood by humans and are closer to natural language than machine language.
These languages are more abstract and allow programmers to write code at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on the problem-solving logic rather than the 
intricate details of the computer's architecture.

## Examples of High level programming language
* Python, 
* Java, 
* C#, 
* JavaScript, 
* Ruby etc..

### Application
High-level languages are often used for a wide range of applications, including
* web development, 
* mobile app development, 
* data science, 
* artificial intelligence, and more.

> [!TIP]
> High level programming is quiet easy and fun
> compared to low level programming.
